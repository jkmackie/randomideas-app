# Random Ideas App

The Random Ideas app is a website that saves random ideas from different users on a card.  The ideas are stored in a database.  Ideas submitted from your Username may be deleted.  Use the plus sign in the top left corner to add an idea.

This full stack app has a Webpack front-end source code bundler, Express API, and cloud MongoDB database.

Build the app from the client folder by using the ```npm run build``` command.  This generates production files in the public folder, an Express static folder.

The [**Render.com**](https://render.com/) host  builds and deploys changes to this repo.

The project is from the [Modern JavaScript from The Beginning 2.0 course](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0).
