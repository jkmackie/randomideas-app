# Random Ideas App

![Random Ideas App Image](random_ideas_image_for_readme.PNG)

The Random Ideas app is a [website](https://randomideas-7qu0.onrender.com/) that saves random ideas from different users on a card.  Use the plus (+)  in the top left corner to add an idea.  The ideas are stored in a database.  Ideas submitted from your Username may be deleted.  

This full stack app uses a Webpack front-end source code bundler, Express API, and cloud MongoDB database.

Build the app from the client folder by using the ```npm run build``` command.  This generates production files in the public folder, an Express static folder.

The [Render.com](https://render.com/) host  builds and deploys changes to this repo.  The project is from the [Modern JavaScript from The Beginning 2.0 course](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0).
